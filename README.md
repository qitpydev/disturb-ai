# Disturb-AI Chrome Extension

Disturb-AI is a proposed browser extension that helps you stay mindful of distractions while working online. It prompts you to state your focus goal, detects distracting browsing behavior using the OpenAI API, and alerts you when your focus strays for too long. The extension is meant to be subtle and customizable, letting you set thresholds, alert style, and site whitelist.

## Development Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies and load the extension in Chrome's developer mode.
3. Provide your OpenAI API key in the settings page to enable distraction detection.

For details on planned features, see the [idea document](prompts.md).

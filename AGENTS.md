# 🧠 Idea

People today are easily distracted while trying to focus on tasks. This constant interruption reduces productivity and attention span.

# 💡 Proposed Solution

Develop a Chrome extension that helps users stay mindful and aware whenever they become distracted.

---

# 🔍 Solution Details

## 🎯 User Input for Contextual Awareness

- Upon activation, the extension prompts the user to enter a brief description of what they are focusing on.
- This input will help determine which websites are considered “safe” vs. “distracting.”
- If no input is given, the extension remains in **inactive** mode (does nothing).

## 🧠 Self-learning
- The extension should Learn from user behavior and adjust its behavior accordingly by times.
- The extension should Learn form user inputs and adjust its behavior accordingly by times.
- The learned data should be stored locally in the browser as a JSON file.
- The extension should be able to update the data it learned by times.

## 🧠 Distraction Detection via AI

- Use OpenAI API to analyze browser activity and detect distractions.
- Behavior data is collected locally from the user's browser session.

## 🚨 Alert System with Warning Levels

- Multiple warning levels: *mild*, *moderate*, and *severe*.
- A short distraction (e.g., a quick notification check) is ignored.
- Extended or frequent distractions trigger alerts.

## 🔔 Smart Notification Handling

- Do not alert for small, infrequent deviations.
- Alert when time spent on irrelevant content surpasses a threshold.

## 🖼️ User Interface

- UI should be sleek, intuitive, and non-intrusive.
- Designed to enhance focus without being a distraction itself.

## ⚙️ Settings Page

- Input field for OpenAI API key.
- Configurable options:
  - Distraction threshold
  - Alert type/style
  - Whitelisted websites
